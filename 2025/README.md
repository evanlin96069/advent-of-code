# 2025
I plan to do this year in my programming language [ika](https://github.com/evanlin96069/ika) and probably a few days in [Kuroko](https://github.com/kuroko-lang/kuroko).

Usage: `make day1` (or `make day5`, etc.)

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ika | ika |
| 2 | Kuroko | Kuroko |
| 3 | ika | Kuroko |
